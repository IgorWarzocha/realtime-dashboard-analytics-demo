# Dasher

A real-time ad analytics dashboard built to demonstrate AI-powered development.

## About This Project

Dasher was vibecoded in 5 hours using Gemini 3 Flash as an experiment in AI-assisted software development. The application demonstrates how modern AI tools can accelerate the creation of production-ready software.

## What It Does

Dasher provides a live dashboard for monitoring advertising campaign performance across multiple customers and brands. Key features include:

- Real-time metrics tracking with live updates
- Customer and brand filtering via sidebar navigation
- Campaign performance tables with sortable data
- KPI bars showing impressions, clicks, and conversions
- Historical time-series analytics
- Interactive simulation mode for testing scenarios

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React 19 with TypeScript
- Backend: Convex (real-time database)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS 4
- Build: Vite

## Running Locally

This is a demonstration project and requires a Convex deployment. The application uses mock data seeded through Convex's backend.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Purpose

This project serves as a proof-of-concept for rapid development workflows using AI assistance. The codebase emphasizes clean architecture, performance optimization patterns, and modern React practices.
